# Projects and Activities

Here is a Brief Description of the projects:

## Decade Counter
* Use the D flip flops, Nand Gates, and BCD to 7-segment decoder
* The picture are the schematic for the circuit and the circuit built
* The Project was built in 20 - 30 minutes

## IDEA Arduino LED Workshop
* The workshop is designed for the Industrial Design Students to have the basic knowledge of LED, circuits, and programming 
* The picture shows the final project designed for the IDEA Arduino LED Workshop
* It gave the attendees a general idea on how to utilize  Arduino into their Lantern Projects

## [Square Wave Generator](https://github.com/spypaul/Square-Wave-Generator.git) 
* Create a square wave generator with a terminal interface to control the frequency of the signal
* Use the "bit-banging" method on a GPIO port generates the square wave with a certain frequency
* Involve the understanding of the frequency of the MCU and the period of each assembly command is needed

## [Simple Stopwatch](https://github.com/spypaul/Simple-Stopwatch.git) 
* Create a simple stopwatch with the ability to change the counting frequency with peripheral switches and a button to halt the watch
* Configure and use the peripheral LPTTIMER by using "polling method"
* Involve creating a software loop to check the flags on the timer

## [Keyboard Reader](https://github.com/spypaul/Keyboard-Reader.git)
* Involve the usage of the USB HID interface on the Nexys 4 and the Ps2 protocol of the keyboard
* Create a 22 bits shift register to capture the key up code and the scan code
* Image on the right is the Signals from the keyboard

## [VGA Controller](https://github.com/spypaul/VGA-Controller.git)
* This project involves the usage of the VGA port on the Nexys 4 and the VGA monitor.
* The switch on the Nexys 4 board will control the overall color of the screen
* The challenge of the project is to create proper Vsync and Hsync signal

## [Paulaga - Retro Video Games](https://github.com/spypaul/Paulaga-Retro-Video-Game.git) 
* Recreated a Retro Video Game similar to the Well-known, Galaga
* State machines are created to determine the states of the objects in the game
* Create internal signals to represent the coordinates of the objects in the game

## [Speech Recognition](https://github.com/spypaul/Speech-Recognition.git)
* The system can recognize five single words: "cookies", "fish", "hamburger", "pizza", and "special"
* Use the "cross-correlation" method to recognize the word by comparing input signals with pre-recorded data

## [Braille Cell Display PCB](https://github.com/spypaul/Braille-Cell-Display-PCB.git) 
* Implement the Braille Cell Display design of an Industrial Design Student.
* Use mini motor and PCBs to create the display
* The pictures are the PCB layouts and the inside circuit of the Display

## [IoT Led System](https://github.com/spypaul/IoT-Led-System.git) 
* There are three main parts of the system: the communication between Arduino and FPGA, LED control, and wifi web server
* Created a UART interface in Verilog on the Nexys A7 to drive the Bluetooth modules
* The picture shows every components of the project
